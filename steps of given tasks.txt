1. Execute the Last two commands:
--> WIFI_FIRMWARE=y DISTRO=fsl-imx-xwayland MACHINE=edm-g-imx8mm source tn-setup-release.sh -b build
--> bitbake core-image-minimal

2. Create new Meta-Layer
--> cd technexion_yocto/sources
--> bitbake-layers create-layer ../sources/meta-varshil

3. Add that layer
--> bitbake-layers add-layer ../sources/meta-varshil

4. Check Package (For Example I have package jinja2.10)
--> technexion_yocto/sources/meta-open embedded/meta-python/recipes-devtools/python
--> You can find there your given packages like I have jinja2 so I can find Jinja2 inc file and bb file. 
--> You can find packages using the file command in Linux.

--> Open their inc file in the new terminal and the bb file and copy both file using nano command
--> Now go to your created meta-layer and see the structure.

--> Go to meta-varshil and type this command: tree -L 2 recipes-example

--> Rename (using mv command) the example bb file which will be present already when you create a custom meta layer
--> Your example bb file name would be like jinja2_2.10.bb(packageName_version.bb)

--> create inc file in that using nano command and paste it.
--> copy and paste both bb and inc file

--> Bitbake the package (for example python3-jinja2)
--> go to conf/local.conf which will avaiable in build directory.
--> IMAGE_INSTALL_append = "python3-jinja2"
--> bitbake image
